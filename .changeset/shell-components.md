Added the Shell components every product's chrome is built from (Figma page "Shell"): `app-shell` (`AppShell`, `AppShellPin`), `top-navigation` (`TopNavigation`, `UrbanflowTopNav`), `proposal-badge` (`ProposalBadge`, `ProposalTitle`), `utilities-toolbar` and `left-context-panel`. Install with `npx shadcn add @urbanflow/app-shell` (and the others you need); pass your product's logo to `TopNavigation`, and put product modes or tools in `UtilitiesToolbar` on the canvas rather than in the top bar.

Added `HvacIcon` and `RunIcon` (Flux's HVAC and Runs modes).

Figma now draws icons in `texticons-placeholder` (40%) instead of `texticons-secondary`. Icons still paint `currentColor`, so nothing changes in your app until you set the colour; new components use `text-texticons-placeholder` for idle icons.

The urbanflow mark is now on the site as SVG: `/brand/urbanflow-mark.svg` and `/brand/urbanflow-mark-white.svg` (white, for the top bar). The Shell demo uses the white one.
